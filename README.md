Raspberry Pi Heating/Lighting Project

This project combines a temperature sensor, 110v 10A relay triggered by a 5v signal from the Raspberry Pi, motion sensor and eventually a web interface as well.


The entire project will combine the control of the heating and lighting system of the Computer Sceience Lab at Olivet College.
